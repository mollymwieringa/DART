The directories under this directory contain the results from running a series of L96 tests with
regression of quantile increments. These experiments can be compared to results for both standard
filters and MA filters in 
/Users/jla/jla_home/GIT_DART_DOWNLOADS/DART_EXPLORATION/models/lorenz_96/work

Full results are available for three different basic forward operators,
Standard 40 nonidentity observations, square root of the absolute value observations, and square 
observations. Limited results were run for cube observations which proved to be very challenging
for all filter types.

Directories for results are  QCEF_PAPER_NONID_errvar_period, QCEF_PAPER_SQRT_errvar_period,
QCEF_PAPER_SQUARE_errvar_period, and QCEF_PAPER_CUBE_errvar_period.

The runs here used adaptive inflation, but specified GC localization. Ensmble sizes of 20, 40, 80 and
160 were used. An initial tuning exercise was done by running a case for each of 8 localization
halfwidths. The results of these tuning cases are in QCEF_RESULTS. The runs were created by the 
script state_space_auto_filter.csh which is found in each directory. A matlab script 
QCEFF_summary_results.m in this directory was run to create two files with the best case 
localization parameters for each ensemble size:
QCEFF_SUMMARY_PRIOR adn QCEFF_SUMMARY_POST
The first of these has the results for the inflation cases with the smallest prior RMSE, while the 
second has the results for the inflation case with the smallest posterior RMSE. The second 
files were not used further here.

A set of 10 runs from different initial conditions was performed for each of the ensemble sizes
with the optimal localization setting. This was done using the script summary_runs.csh in this
directory and generates output in the file QCEF_output_ten.

The nameslist for these runs comes from INPUT.NML.QCEF.TEMPLATE. The only thing of interest is 
the inflation settings which had inf_lower_bound = 0 and inf_upper_bound = 1000000. The inf_damping 
was 0.9. The inf_sd_initial and inf_sd_lower_bound were set to 0.6 for the NONID and SQRT cases
but to 0.2 for the SQUARE and CUBE cases to try to stabilize the inflation.


This entire process was repated for the NONID, SQRT and SQUARE cases with the inflation lower bound 
set to 1 (no deflation) and the upper bound set to 2. The damping was 0.9 and the 
inf_sd_initial and inf_sd_lower_bound were the standard 0.6. The input.nml came from
REV.INPUT.NML.QCEF.TEMPLATE. These runs can be compared
to similar REV results in the DART_EXPLORATION branch/directory. The tuning was done with the script
rev_state_space_auto_filter.csh. The results are in REV_QCEF_RESULTS. The script 
REV_QCEFF_summary_results.csh extracted the best cases and wrote them to
REV_QCEFF_SUMMARY_POST and REV_QCEFF_SUMMARY_PRIOR. The 10 different runs were created
using rev_summary_runs.csh and written to REV_QCEF_output_ten. These are the results that are
used for the figure results for the QCEF paper part 2. 

Note that there are a handful of cases that fail when generating the ten cases. This is noted
by the number of steps in the output files (should be 5500 for success). Failures only occured 
for the SQUARE forward operator. 

Note 2: One of the cases in the output_ten files for each ensemble size should be idential to 
the tuning run. However, in some cases the tuning runs were done for the first on the ten
perfect_ics file, and in some for the tenth. This should not impact the validity of the result
in any way but could be confusing when trying to understand how the cases were generated.

Several plotting scripts are available here. 
plot_ten_nonid_rmse.m, plot_ten_sqrt_rmse.m, and plot_ten_square_rmse.m for the different cases.
These also access comparable results from the DART_EXPLORATION directory (EAKF, EnKF, RHF
with standard regression).
